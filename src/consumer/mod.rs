/// `Consumer` is used to run a worker that processes jobs provided by Faktory.
///
/// # Building the worker
///
/// Faktory needs a decent amount of information from its workers, such as a unique worker ID, a
/// hostname for the worker, its process ID, and a set of labels used to identify the worker. In
/// order to enable setting all these, constructing a worker is a two-step process. You first use a
/// [`ConsumerBuilder`](struct.ConsumerBuilder.html) (which conveniently implements a sensible
/// `Default`) to set the worker metadata, as well as to register any job handlers. You then use
/// one of the `connect_*` methods to finalize the worker and connect to the Faktory server.
///
/// In most cases, `ConsumerBuilder::default()` will do what you want. You only need to augment it
/// with calls to [`register`](struct.ConsumerBuilder.html#method.register) to register handlers
/// for each of your job types, and then you can connect. If you have different *types* of workers,
/// you may also want to use [`labels`](struct.ConsumerBuilder.html#method.labels) to distinguish
/// them in the Faktory Web UI. To specify that some jobs should only go to some workers, use
/// different queues.
///
/// ## Handlers
///
/// For each [`Job`](struct.Job.html) that the worker receives, the handler that is registered for
/// that job's type will be called. If a job is received with a type for which no handler exists,
/// the job will be failed and returned to the Faktory server. Similarly, if a handler returns an
/// error response, the job will be failed, and the error reported back to the Faktory server.
///
/// If you are new to Rust, getting the handler types to work out can be a little tricky. If you
/// want to understand why, I highly recommend that you have a look at the chapter on [closures and
/// generic
/// parameters](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch13-01-closures.html#using-closures-with-generic-parameters-and-the-fn-traits)
/// in the Rust Book. If you just want it to work, my recommendation is to either use regular
/// functions instead of closures, and giving `&func_name` as the handler, **or** wrapping all your
/// closures in `Box::new()`.
///
/// ## Concurrency
///
/// By default, only a single thread is spun up to process the jobs given to this worker. If you
/// want to dedicate more resources to processing jobs, you have a number of options listed below.
/// As you go down the list below, efficiency increases, but fault isolation decreases. I will not
/// give further detail here, but rather recommend that if these don't mean much to you, you should
/// use the last approach and let the library handle the concurrency for you.
///
///  - You can spin up more worker processes by launching your worker program more than once.
///  - You can create more than one `Consumer`.
///  - You can call [`ConsumerBuilder::workers`](struct.ConsumerBuilder.html#method.workers) to set
///    the number of worker threads you'd like the `Consumer` to use internally.
///
/// # Connecting to Faktory
///
/// To fetch jobs, the `Consumer` must first be connected to the Faktory server. Exactly how you do
/// that depends on your setup. In most cases, you'll want to use `Consumer::connect`, and provide
/// a connection URL. If you supply a URL, it must be of the form:
///
/// ```text
/// protocol://[:password@]hostname[:port]
/// ```
///
/// Faktory suggests using the `FAKTORY_PROVIDER` and `FAKTORY_URL` environment variables (see
/// their docs for more information) with `localhost:7419` as the fallback default. If you want
/// this behavior, pass `None` as the URL.
///
/// See the [`Producer` examples](struct.Producer.html#examples) for examples of how to connect to
/// different Factory setups.
///
/// # Worker lifecycle
///
/// Okay, so you've built your worker and connected to the Faktory server. Now what?
///
/// If all this process is doing is handling jobs, reconnecting on failure, and exiting when told
/// to by the Faktory server, you should use
/// [`run_to_completion`](struct.Consumer.html#method.run_to_completion). If you want more
/// fine-grained control over the lifetime of your process, you should use
/// [`Consumer::run`](struct.Consumer.html#method.run). See the documentation for each of these
/// methods for details.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Create a worker with all default options, register a single handler (for the `foobar` job
/// type), connect to the Faktory server, and start accepting jobs.
///
/// ```no_run
/// use faktory::ConsumerBuilder;
/// use std::io;
/// let mut c = ConsumerBuilder::default();
/// c.register("foobar", |job| -> io::Result<()> {
///     println!("{:?}", job);
///     Ok(())
/// });
/// let mut c = c.connect(None).unwrap();
/// if let Err(e) = c.run(&["default"]) {
///     println!("worker failed: {}", e);
/// }
