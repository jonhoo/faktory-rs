/// `Producer` is used to enqueue new jobs that will in turn be processed by Faktory workers.
///
/// # Connecting to Faktory
///
/// To issue jobs, the `Producer` must first be connected to the Faktory server. Exactly how you do
/// that depends on your setup. Faktory suggests using the `FAKTORY_PROVIDER` and `FAKTORY_URL`
/// environment variables (see their docs for more information) with `localhost:7419` as the
/// fallback default. If you want this behavior, pass `None` to
/// [`Producer::connect`](struct.Producer.html#method.connect). If not, you can supply the URL
/// directly to [`Producer::connect`](struct.Producer.html#method.connect) in the form:
///
/// ```text
/// protocol://[:password@]hostname[:port]
/// ```
///
///
/// # Issuing jobs
///
/// Most of the lifetime of a `Producer` will be spent creating and enqueueing jobs for Faktory
/// workers. This is done by passing a [`Job`](struct.Job.html) to
/// [`Producer::enqueue`](struct.Producer.html#method.enqueue). The most important part of a `Job`
/// is its `kind`; this field dictates how workers will execute the job when they receive it. The
/// string provided here must match a handler registered on the worker using
/// [`ConsumerBuilder::register`](struct.ConsumerBuilder.html#method.register) (or the equivalent
/// handler registration method in workers written in other languages).
///
/// Since Faktory workers do not all need to be the same (you could have some written in Rust for
/// performance-critical tasks, some in Ruby for more webby tasks, etc.), it may be the case that a
/// given job can only be executed by some workers (e.g., if they job type is not registered at
/// others). To allow for this, Faktory includes a `labels` field with each job. Jobs will only be
/// sent to workers whose labels (see
/// [`ConsumerBuilder::labels`](struct.ConsumerBuilder.html#method.labels)) match those set in
/// `Job::labels`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Connecting to an unsecured Faktory server using environment variables
///
/// ```no_run
/// use faktory::Producer;
/// let p = Producer::connect(None).unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// Connecting to a secured Faktory server using an explicit URL
///
/// ```no_run
/// use faktory::Producer;
/// let p = Producer::connect(Some("tcp://:hunter2@localhost:7439")).unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// Issuing a job using a `Producer`
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use faktory::Producer;
/// # let mut p = Producer::connect(None).unwrap();
/// use faktory::Job;
/// p.enqueue(Job::new("foobar", vec!["z"])).unwrap();
/// ```
